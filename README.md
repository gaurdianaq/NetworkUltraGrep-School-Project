# NetworkUltraGrep-School-Project

This was a project I worked on in my final semester of college. The goal of the project was to write a client/server app where the client would connect to the server over TCP and you could send commands to run grep like commands on the server. The server would make use of multiple threads on the machine for efficiency. All the file searching was implemented in C++ and it would generate a report of results found.
